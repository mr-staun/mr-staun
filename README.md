Hey, I'm Peter!

I fell in love with AI when I was younger, and realized my dream of working in the when I moved to Adelaide :)
I'm currently an Artificial Intelligence Specialist, working on automating microbiology plate screening.

I love reading, singing, and going out for adventures. I'm alway looking for a new hobby, something new to learn, or starting a new side project.

I started my programming journey with Java, but I have learnt to code in many other languages: Bash, C, C++, JavaScript, Python, SQL and VBA.
